    <h1>ITALIAN CHICKEN MARINADE</h1>
    <img src="/home/devworld/Pictures">
    <h2><strong><em>This Italian dressing chicken marinade is a super simple but delicious way to add flavor before grilling.</em></strong></h2>
    <p>Simple and delicious - I use half a bottle of Kraft light italian dressing and add minced garlic, cracked black pepper, italian seasoning, oregano, basil, a little white wine, 1/4 c. of olive oil, and a couple of sprigs of fresh rosemary. I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it go. This is great with a salad or over pasta.</p>
    <h3><em>INGREDIENTS</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>STEPS</em></h3>
    <OL>
        <ol>Whisk salad dressing, garlic powder, and salt together in a shallow baking dish; add chicken breasts and turn to coat. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.</ol>
        <ol>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</ol>
        <ol>Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade</ol>
        <ol>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 7 to 8 minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F</ol>
